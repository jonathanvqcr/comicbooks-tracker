# Comic Books Tracker - Specification

## Overview

A single-page web app to track comic book collections by series (line). The primary goal is to see at a glance which issues you own (cover A) and which are missing from each consecutive run.

## Phase

**Prototype / Phase 1** - Local-only, data driven by a JSON file. Phase 2 (out of scope) will add a backend and deploy as a live website.


---

## Features

### Dashboard View

* List of all comic book series (lines) with summary cards.
* Each card shows:
  * Series name (e.g. "Absolute Batman")
  * Publisher (e.g. DC)
  * Total issues tracked (e.g. 1–17)
  * Number owned vs total
  * Completion percentage with a visual progress bar
  * Status indicator: complete, in-progress, or not-started
* Ability to filter/search series by name.
* Sort by: name, completion %, or total issues.

### Series Detail View

* Grid of issue numbers (1 through N).
* Each cell shows issue number and owned/missing status (color-coded).
* Gaps in the collection are visually obvious (e.g. red/empty cells).
* Clicking a cell could toggle owned status in a future phase.

## Data Source

Initial data comes from `comic_collection_tracker.xlsx` (in Downloads), which has three sheets:

* **All Purchases**: Order Date, Series, Volume #, Cover, Item Name, Price, Currency, Qty, Seller
* **Collection Summary**: Pre-computed summary per series with volumes owned, missing volumes, Cover A status
* **Non-Comic Purchases**: Ignored

A one-time Python script (`scripts/import.py`) parses the xlsx and generates `src/data/collection.json`. After that, the JSON file is the source of truth and can be manually edited.

### Actual Collection (15 series)

| Series | Volumes | Cover A owned | Cover A missing |
|----|----|----|----|
| Absolute Batman | 1–17 | 2–17 | 1 |
| Absolute Batman Annual | 1 | 1 | — |
| Absolute Batman Ark-M Special | 1 | 1 | — |
| Absolute Evil | 1 | 1 | — |
| Absolute Flash | 1–12 | 2–10, 12 | 1, 11 |
| Absolute Superman | 1–16 | 2–16 | 1 |
| Absolute Wonder Woman | 1, 15 | 15 | 1 |
| Batman | 1 | — | 1 |
| Batman/Deadpool | 1 | — | 1 |
| Batman: The Dark Knight Returns | 1 | — | 1 |
| DC All In Special | 1 | 1 | — |
| DC K.O. | 1–4 | 1–4 | — |
| DC K.O. Knightfight | 1–4 | 1–4 | — |
| DC K.O. One-Shots | 1 | 1 | — |
| Deadpool/Batman | 1 | — | 1 |

## Data Model

All data lives in a single JSON file: `src/data/collection.json`.

```json
{
  "series": [
    {
      "id": "absolute-batman",
      "name": "Absolute Batman",
      "publisher": "DC",
      "totalIssues": 17,
      "ownedCoverA": [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17],
      "ownedOther": [1]
    }
  ]
}
```

* **id**: URL-friendly slug, unique identifier.
* **name**: Display name.
* **publisher**: Publisher label.
* **totalIssues**: Highest issue number in the run being tracked.
* **ownedCoverA**: Issue numbers where you own cover A.
* **ownedOther**: Issue numbers where you own a non-A cover but NOT cover A (helps distinguish "have it but wrong cover" from "don't have it at all").

Missing issues are derived: any number in `1..totalIssues` not in `ownedCoverA` and not in `ownedOther`.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|----|----|
| Framework | React 18+ with Vite |
| Routing | React Router |
| Styling | CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS |
| Data | Static JSON import |
| Language | TypeScript |

No backend, no database, no build-time data fetching. The JSON file is imported directly.

## Architecture

```
scripts/
  import.py                # one-time xlsx → JSON converter
src/
  data/
    collection.json        # the single source of truth (generated by import.py)
  types/
    index.ts               # TypeScript interfaces
  utils/
    collection.ts          # helper functions (completion %, missing issues, etc.)
  components/
    Dashboard/
      Dashboard.tsx
      SeriesCard.tsx
      SearchBar.tsx
    SeriesDetail/
      SeriesDetail.tsx
      IssueGrid.tsx
      IssueCell.tsx
    Layout/
      Layout.tsx
      Header.tsx
  App.tsx
  main.tsx
```

### Routes

| Path | Component | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `/` | Dashboard | Summary of all series |
| `/series/:id` | SeriesDetail | Issue grid for one series |


---

## UI/UX Notes

* Responsive: works on desktop and mobile.
* Dark theme preferred (comic book aesthetic).
* Progress bars use green (complete) to red (empty) gradient.
* Issue grid cells: green = owned (cover A), yellow/amber = owned (non-A cover), dark/muted = missing entirely.
* Keep it minimal - no animations or heavy styling needed for prototype.


---

## Concerns & Risks


1. **Data editing**: In this phase, editing requires manually updating the JSON file and refreshing. Acceptable for a prototype.
2. **Scalability**: A flat JSON file works for a personal collection of \~20-50 series. Phase 2 should move to a database.
3. **No authentication**: Not needed for a local prototype.
4. **Cover variants**: Only cover A is tracked. The data model could later add a `variants` array per issue if needed.


---

## Future Improvements (Phase 2+)

* UI-based add/edit/delete for series and issues.
* Persistent backend (SQLite or Postgres).
* Deploy to Vercel/Netlify.
* Cover art thumbnails via an external API (e.g. Comic Vine).
* Re-import from updated xlsx to refresh data.
* Price tracking and total spend (data already available in xlsx).
* Wish list for missing issues.
